Treeview 2.0 Module - ISDesign.tv
========

This module allow you to get a quick, minimal, user-friendly, beautyfull
way to present "selections choices" to the end-user.

It allows to handle multiple or single selection, with or without priority, with group filters and search, among hundreds
of items, without any code adding!

Simply:

*******
> Choose you preferred treeview configuration based on which interface element you wish to get. 

> Describe the objects that will represent the items that the user could select, and pull it into the plugin

> And you're Done!

*******

The Treeview will handle the presentation of the choice screen, and all the selection process.


And if you wish to get more involved:

Every element is fully customizable in design, and the core code and functionality is full extendable and override-able.

More functionaly will come soon!
