Treeview 2.0
========

I wrote this plugin to study the plugins creation process on Javascript. 

This module allow you to get a quick, user-friendly, beautiful window to present "selections choices" to the end-user, with a minimal effort.

It handles multiple or single selections, with priority, group filters, search and much more!

Simply:

*******
> Choose the UI elements you wish to get. 

> Describe the objects that the user would select

> Done!

*******

The Treeview will handle all the selection process.

Every element is fully customizable in design, and the core code and functionality is full extendable.
